# Beyond Redux

This is a highly experimental project to see how far I can push an app using firebase and Observable (RxJS) to stream events
from firebase and the UI on a more tightly coupled per-component basis.

The reality is, some kind of client side state for things like `modal.isOpen` has yet to be figured out but the database itself
is coming along.
